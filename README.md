This example demonstrates a common, yet subtle, error in Perl when working with hashes.  Accessing a hash key that doesn't exist doesn't result in an error or undef, but instead returns an empty string. This can cause unexpected behavior and logic errors, especially when used in conditional statements or numerical operations. The solution shows how to explicitly check for the existence of the key before using its value.
